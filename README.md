# FinTrack

## ðŸ’» Project
FinTrack is a financial control application that allows users to register income and expenses and search using filters. Each transaction has a title, amount, category, and date. In addition to putting into practice knowledge about TypeScript, Styled-components, API consumption, and forms in React, it was possible to learn more about libraries that improve accessibility.

With FinTrack, I used:

- styled-components for styling and theme creation;
